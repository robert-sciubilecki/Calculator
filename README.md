This is a very simple calculator written as a refresher for recursion.
Could've been a lot simpler and do the same job but I guess that wasn't 
the point

The code is NOT user proof, at this point I'd assume the user would input
valid data when asked.

This code was written as an exercise project from the '100 days of code' bootcamp by Dr. Angela Yu. 
But in reality I have written the code without course instruction beyond starting point and main idea
for the project approach.
